  SampleText: "A Markov process is a stochastic process that satisfies the Markov
    property sometimes characterized as \"memorylessness\". In simpler terms, it
    is a process for which predictions can be made regarding future outcomes based
    solely on its present state and\u2014most importantly\u2014such predictions are
    just as good as the ones that could be made knowing the process's full history.
    In other words, conditional on the present state of the system, its future and
    past states are independent. A Markov chain is a type of Markov process that
    has either a discrete state space or a discrete index set often representing
    time, but the precise definition of a Markov chain varies.For example, it is
    common to define a Markov chain as a Markov process in either discrete or continuous
    time with a countable state space thus regardless of the nature of time,but it
    is also common to define a Markov chain as having discrete time in either countable
    or continuous state space thus regardless of the state space"
